Explain how the puzzle package works and how you use
it to solve your JugPuzzle. Your explanation should convince
us that you understand inheritance, interfaces as well as how
the code in solve uses these to solve any puzzle which correctly
uses the framework.

The Move class in the puzzle packages is an 
interface(that defines a move) used by JugPuzzleSolver 
to make a move.

The States class is an interface that Puzzle uses(as 
the nextState method in Puzzle needs to use methods in States.

The solve method in Puzzle determines the moves that 
need to be taken in order to solve the jug puzzle, 
and that solve function relies on the nextStates that 
is also in puzzle.

The nextStates method in Puzzle uses the setPreviousState 
method in class States to hold the value of the current state.

The printSolution method in Puzzle uses previousState
to follow a path from solved puzzle back to initial 
puzzle and so can print the moves needed to solve the puzzle.


The states parameter in nextStates has all the 
states that are one move away from 'this'(i.e the previousState value') puzzle. 
nextStates is a method in Puzzle that is executed 
in order to do something with it states parameter 
and return info to the solve function in the Puzzle class.
