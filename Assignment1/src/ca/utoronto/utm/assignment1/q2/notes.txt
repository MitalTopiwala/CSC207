Explain how the puzzle package works and how you use
it to solve your JugPuzzle. Your explanation should convince
us that you understand inheritance, interfaces as well as how
the code in solve uses these to solve any puzzle which correctly
uses the framework.

The Move class in the puzzle packages is an 
interface that will be implemented by JugMove

The JugPuzzle class extends the Puzzle class.

The solve method in Puzzle determines the moves that 
need to be taken in order to solve the jug puzzle, 
and that solve function relies on the nextStates method which 
is in JugPuzzle.

The nextStates method in JugPuzzle relies on the allPossibleMoves
method which is also in the JugPuzzle class.

The printSolution method in Puzzle uses previousState
to follow a path from solved puzzle back to initial 
puzzle and so can print the moves needed to solve the puzzle.
